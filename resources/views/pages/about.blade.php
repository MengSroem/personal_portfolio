                <p>
                    I started my journey in computer science with a curiosity about how websites and applications 
                    work. Over the years, I've developed strong skills in web development, working with various 
                    technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP frameworks like Laravel. 
                    I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with others to build 
                    amazing digital experiences.
